this is on ubuntu 18.03

make host name "basicnvr'
user basicnvr password xxxxx

ignore this   ---------- network enp1so and enp3so looks like the pcie card became enp1so
install with as little as possiable, just required utilities  -- DO NOT select LAMP server too much baggage

use entire disk

only install:
OpenSSH Server

wait for reboot

login and get the ip address with ifconfig

login as simplnvr foobar
sudo su

passwd root     --- foobar
passwd -u root

sudo su
setterm -blank 0   -- only needed from console

reboot

===================================
now The basicnvr install starts
note: all the instalation goes into /root

easiest to do with a remote terminal like Putty

if going remote login as basicnvr and

sudo su   --- to become root

do a "cd" to position you at /root
cd /root

now pull in the things needed

sftp jim@192.168.1.??    ## currently desk linux machine login as jim foobar
get Dropbox/source/perl_modules.tar.gz
get Dropbox/source/simplenvr/loader.pl
get Dropbox/source/simplenvr/configure.pl
get Dropbox/source/simplenvr/motion-master.zip
exit

perl configure.pl
